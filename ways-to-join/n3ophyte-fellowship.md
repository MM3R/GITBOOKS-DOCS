# â—» n3ophyte fellowship

## what is this fellowship?



**the **<mark style="color:purple;">**midsumm3r n3ophyte fellowship**</mark>** is an opportunity for folks with little experience in filmmaking to get paid to pursue their storytelling passion with us (in front or behind the cameras).**



**fellows will be awarded **<mark style="color:purple;">**$10k**</mark>** (USDC) during the duration of the program.**



**neophytes will also be receiving the same benefits from our core team, which includes:**

**ðŸŒ¹ invites to our celebrations, events, trips;**

**ðŸŒ¹ the choice of being part of our productions;**

**ðŸŒ¹ 1-1 tutoring (on a request basis);**

**ðŸŒ¹ safe havens at any of our academy's houses;**

**ðŸŒ¹ and, of course, cool swags.**&#x20;



## wen?



**applications for **<mark style="color:purple;">**fall/22**</mark>** are closed.**

**new round of applications starts in winter.**



## what would i be doing as a fellow?



**this is an absolutely open-ended role. you already know what you want to work on.**&#x20;

**fellows** [**will be streamed the $10k (USDC) award**](https://sablier.finance/) **through the program and will be checking-in with us at their own pace.**

**by the end of the program, we will broadcast the projects using web3 technologies (which ensures that the art is forever registered on the blockchains).**



## how do i get selected?



**first, the classic "be yourself".**

**then, convince us that you know what we are thinking and we vibe on the same wavelength.**
